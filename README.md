# Dia-Nvim
This is my Neovim configuration.
It is based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
And Thanks to ADICS, KickStart and Others Plugin & Config Contributors,
You can what I designed like I prefer the most, here.😄😁

## Notice!!
- I am just a newbie and I am not responsible for any problems.
- And I am now setting up on Windows OS.

## Suggestions 🤔
- You shuld have Package Managers Like: "**Chocolatey, Scoop**"
  - Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org/
  - Scoop: https://scoop.sh/
  - So, you can install packages when `winget` get errors sometimes.
- Also, For `Codeium Ai` plugin, you need to download [`Languge Server for Windows`](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-langservers-extracted/releases)

>   Sorry for the lack of comments and insufficient documentation for now.😔
